## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, EJS

I used Node and Express to create CRUD POST and GET routes in order to create and add objects into my MongoDB datatbase and to get that data from the same database. 

## Optimizations

I plan to add put and delete methods within my EJS and client side JavaScript files in order to give users the power to edit and delete posts. Additionally, I plan to style using CSS once I have the back-end complete.

## Lessons Learned:

I've learned how to use CRUD methods to get/read objects and add objects to a MongoDB database. I plan to implement the put and delete methods but I am currently working at that portion.
